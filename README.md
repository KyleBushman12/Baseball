# Baseball

This repo contains the files used in my personal project preciting outcomes of MLB games. There are many different types of models used in these predictions. Most of the models are built in R, but the neural network was built using python. A major component of the analysis is including odds from DraftKings to compare my results with the vegas odds. When evaluating with my Pythagoras model, the vegas odds are labeled as "xWin."
